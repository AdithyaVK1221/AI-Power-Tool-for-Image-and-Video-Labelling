# AI-Power-Tool-for-Image-and-Video-Labelling
This project is a AI-Powered Tool for Image and Video Labelling toolkit that combines the power of deep learning with an interactive GUI to make CT scan analysis more accessible and reliable. The motivation came from a simple but impactful question: How can we assist radiologists in identifying lung disease regions faster and with more consistency?
